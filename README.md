This project is a CPU scheduling simulator designed to provide a platform for experimenting with various CPU scheduling algorithms.
Description:

This project is a CPU scheduling simulator designed to provide a platform for experimenting with various CPU scheduling algorithms. The primary goal is to help users understand the impact of different scheduling policies on system performance, resource utilization, and responsiveness.

Features:

 Algorithm Support: Includes implementations of common CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Priority Scheduling, Round Robin, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling.

 Visualization: Offers a visual representation of the scheduling process, allowing users to observe how processes are selected and executed over time.

 Customization: Users can configure parameters such as the number of processes, arrival times, burst times, and priority levels to simulate diverse scenarios.

 Statistics and Analysis: Provides detailed statistics on CPU utilization, waiting times, turnaround times, and other relevant metrics. Enables users to analyze the performance of different algorithms under specific conditions.

 Extensibility: Designed to be easily extended with additional scheduling algorithms or features, encouraging contributions from the open-source community.
